# Starbucks Promotional Offers Data Analysis Portfolio Project
A data analysis project focused on understanding the effectiveness of promotional offers for Starbucks. The dataset includes customer demographic information, event logs, and promotional offers. The project involves cleaning and transforming the data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and generating insights into customer behavior, offer effectiveness, and potential business strategies. The final analysis is visualized using a Tableau dashboard.

The first thing I did was create a project scope utilising Microsoft Word. I then cleaned the data in Jupyter Notebook using Python3
